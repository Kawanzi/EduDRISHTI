# 📚 EduDRISHTI | ML-Driven Anomaly Detection in High-Stakes Exams

## 📖 Introduction  
The **2024 NEET-UG controversy** exposed critical systemic vulnerabilities in India's national high-stakes examinations. The **EduDRISHTI (Data Research for Inequality in Student Test Insights)** project moves beyond anecdotal evidence to provide a rigorous, objective, and **data-driven analysis** of performance integrity and regional inequality using advanced data science and machine learning.

This project executes a full, end-to-end analytics pipeline:
- **Feature Engineering:** Developed sophisticated statistical metrics, notably **Center Skewness**, **Center Kurtosis**, and the **Center-v-National Gap**, to quantify the shape and deviation of score distributions for over 4,750+ exam centers.
- **Machine Learning:** Deployed an **Isolation Forest** model to mathematically flag centers exhibiting statistically **irregular score patterns** across a high-dimensional feature space.
- **Micro-Inequality Quantification:** Used **Ultra-High Score Ratio** to precisely locate and quantify the clustering of top-scoring candidates (marks ≥ 700).
- **Dual-Platform Deployment:** Delivered actionable intelligence via an **Interactive Streamlit Application** for model exploration and a **Professional Power BI Report** for executive summary and geospatial analysis.

## ✨ Features  
- ⚙️ **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Extracted **Skewness** and **Kurtosis** from score distributions to act as primary statistical proxies for non-random clustering or uniformity of scores.
- 🎯 **Unsupervised Anomaly Detection:** Utilized the **Isolation Forest** algorithm from **Scikit-learn** to objectively identify **72 centers** as statistical outliers (Anomaly Flag = -1).
- 🗺️ **Geospatial & Inequality Analysis:** Mapped the **Center-v-National Gap** and the geographical clustering of anomalous centers to identify regional hotspots and structural inequality.
- 📊 **Dual Visualization Platforms:**
  - **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard:** Multi-page application for dynamic model validation and deep-dive exploration.
  - **Professional Power BI Report:** Executive-level report presenting high-level findings, KPIs, and geospatial concentration.
- 🧪 **Model Validation:** Integrated numerical proof (e.g., Average Skewness comparison between flagged and normal groups) directly into the dashboards to prove model integrity.

## 📊 Key Analytical Insights
This project provided critical, objective insights into the 2024 NEET-UG performance:
- ⚠️ **72 Statistically Anomalous Centers:** The ML model flagged 72 centers whose score distribution shape was mathematically inconsistent with the national pattern, providing a clear roadmap for targeted investigation.
- 📉 **Low/Negative Skewness Indication:** Flagged centers often showed unusually low or negative Skewness, strongly suggesting a non-random distribution of scores highly clustered toward the top or middle, rather than the expected high positive skew of a competitive exam.
- 🏙️ **Ultra-High Score Concentration:** Cities like Delhi/New Delhi, Jaipur, and Mumbai showed the highest ratios of Ultra-High Scorers (≥ 700 marks), indicating non-uniform performance clustering.
- 🌏 **Quantified Regional Advantage:** Identified states like Chandigarh, Rajasthan, and Haryana as exhibiting the highest average positive performance gaps, indicating a regional testing advantage.

## 🔄 Project Workflow
- 📂 **Data Preparation:** Raw data is stored in the `data/raw` directory.
- 🐍 **Python Pipeline:**
  - `master_data.py`: Handles the initial ETL, data consolidation, and complex feature engineering (Gaps, Ratios, Skewness/Kurtosis).
  - `anomaly_detection.py`: Contains the model definition, scaling, training, and prediction logic using **Isolation Forest**.
- 📊 **Final Data Export:** The enriched dataset is exported as `NEET_Master_ML_Data.csv`.
- 🖥️ **Dashboard Deployment:** The **Streamlit** app (`app.py`) loads the final data and presents the interactive ML results and regional insights.
- 📈 **Power BI Modeling:** The final CSV is imported into Power BI for report creation (`EduDRISHTI PowerBI Report.pbix`) and static export (`EduDRISHTI PowerBI Report.pdf`).
